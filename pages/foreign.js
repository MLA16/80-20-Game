      <p class="text-gray-700 text-base mb-4">
      India has diplomatic relations with 201 states/dependencies around the globe, having 199 missions and 
            posts operating globally while plans to open new missions in 2020-21 hosted by 11 UN Member States.
            <a class="underline decoration-indigo-500">The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA),</a> also known as the Foreign Ministry, is the government agency 
            responsible for the conduct of foreign relations of India.<br></br><br></br>

With the world's third largest military expenditure, fourth largest armed force, fifth largest economy by GDP 
nominal rates and third largest economy in terms of purchasing power parity, India is a prominent regional 
power, a nuclear power, an emerging global power and a potential superpower. India assumes a growing 
international influence and a prominent voice in global affairs.<br></br><br></br>

As a former British colony, India is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations and continues to maintain 
relationships with other Commonwealth countries. Since gaining independence from Britain in 1947, however, 
India is now classified as a newly industrialised country and has cultivated an extensive network of foreign 
relations with other states. As a member state of BRICS - a repertoire of emerging major economies that also 
encompasses Brazil, Russia, China and South Africa, India also exerts a salient influence as the founding member 
of the Non-Aligned Movement. <a class="underline decoration-indigo-500">In recent decades, India has pursued a more expansive foreign policy that 
encompasses the neighborhood first policy embodied by SAARC as well as the Look East policy to forge more extensive 
economic and strategic relationships with other East Asian countries.</a> Moreover, India was one of the founding 
members of several international organisationsâ€”the United Nations, the Asian Development Bank, New Development 
BRICS Bank, and G-20, widely considered the main economic locus of emerging and developed nations.<br></br><br></br>

India has also played an important and influential role in other international organisations like<a class="underline decoration-indigo-500">
   East Asia Summit, 
World Trade Organization, International Monetary Fund (IMF),G8+5 and IBSA Dialogue Forum.</a> India is also a member 
of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.The idea of long-term 
management of relationships followed the development of professional diplomatic corps that managed diplomacy. 
Since 1711, the term diplomacy has been taken to mean the art and practice of conducting negotiations between 
representatives of groups or nations.<br></br><br></br>

In the 18th century, due to extreme turbulence in European diplomacy and ongoing conflicts, the practice of 
diplomacy was often fragmented by the necessity to deal with isolated issues, termed "affairs". Therefore, while 
domestic management of such issues was termed civil affairs (peasant riots, treasury shortfalls, and court
 intrigues), the term foreign affairs was applied to the management of temporary issues outside the sovereign 
 realm. <a class="underline decoration-indigo-500">This term remained in widespread use in the English-speaking states into the 20th century, and remains the
  name of departments in several states that manage foreign relations.</a> Although originally intended to describe 
  short term management of a specific concern, these departments now manage all day-to-day and long-term 
  international relations among states.<br></br><br></br>

Organisations such as the Council of Foreign Relations in the United States are sometimes employed by government
 foreign relations organisations to develop foreign policy proposals as alternatives to existing policy, or to 
 provide analytical assessments of evolving relationships.</p>
