      <p className="text-gray-700 text-base mb-4">
      The history of independent India began when the country became an independent nation within the British 
             Commonwealth on 15 August 1947. Direct administration by the British, which began in 1858, affected a political
             and economic unification of the subcontinent. When British rule came to an end in 1947, the subcontinent was 
             partitioned along religious lines into two separate countriesâ€”India, with a majority of Hindus, and Pakistan, 
             with a majority of Muslims.<a className="underline decoration-sky-500">Concurrently the Muslim-majority northwest and east of British India was separated 
             into the Dominion of Pakistan, by the partition of India. </a>The partition led to a population transfer of more 
             than 10 million people between India and Pakistan and the death of about one million people. Indian National 
             Congress leader Jawaharlal Nehru became the first Prime Minister of India, but the leader most associated with 
             the independence struggle, Mahatma Gandhi, accepted no office. The Constitution adopted in 1950 made India a 
             democratic country, and this democracy has been sustained since then. India's sustained democratic freedoms 
             are unique among the world's newly independent states.

            Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, who is known for his firebrand speeches on communal 
            issues, has sparked a row with his statement that the elections in the state will be '80 per cent 
            versus 20 per cent', in a veiled reference to the percentage of muslim population in the country.

            He made these comments as Election Commission announced the schedule for the Assembly elections this 
            year, thus enforcing the Model Code of Conduct. Opposition leaders across parties were quick to slam 
            Adityanath's comments, alleging that they were a violation of MCC.
            
            <a className="underline decoration-sky-500">Corruption in India is an issue which affects economy of central, state and local government agencies 
            in many ways. Corruption is blamed for stunting the economy of India.A study conducted by 
            Transparency International in 2005 recorded that more than 62% of Indians had at some point or 
            another paid a bribe to a public official to get a job done.</a>In 2008, another report showed 
            that about 50% of Indians had first hand experience of paying bribes or using contacts to get services 
            performed by public offices.In 2021 their Corruption Perceptions Index ranked the country in 85th 
            place out of 180, on a scale where the lowest-ranked countries are perceived to have the most honest 
            public sector.Various factors contribute to corruption, including officials siphoning money from 
            government social welfare schemes . Examples include the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment 
            Guarantee Act and the National Rural Health Mission. Other areas of corruption include India's 
            trucking industry which is forced to pay billions of rupees in bribes annually to numerous regulatory 
            and police stops on interstate highways.
